<p>Description : Textured atmospheric piano<br>We are pleased to introduce Infinite Upright , a unique piano collection created by our founder and award-winning composer Michael Vignola. Our journey began with a vintage 1980s Baldwin piano, known for its rich tone and resonance. Mike painstakingly performed and developed each sound using modular Eurorack systems and advanced digital and analog processing. Infinite Upright combines traditional piano charm with modern synthesis, offering a wide range of sounds – from soft atmospheric layers to intense, expressive harmonics.</p>
<p>Infinite Upright is a versatile music creation tool. Ideal for soundtracks, ambient, theme songwriting and dynamic sound design, this collection encourages artists to blend classical and contemporary styles while exploring new musical landscapes. We hope Infinite Upright will become a cornerstone of your creative process, inspiring projects and enhancing your artistic expression. Thank you for joining Emergence Audio on this journey. Let Infinite Upright open up new creative possibilities for you.</p>
<p>New in version 1.0.2 (from 2024-07-24) :<br>• Fixed: Mapping Constellations 1 mapping issue has been addressed</p>

<p>Description : Playground bells<br>The second instrument in our Blueprint series was recorded in Fracture Sounds’ hometown of Huddersfield, Greenhead Park. The team encountered difficulties recording between the quacks of ducks at dusk, but pulled through and created a library that would influence future creations in Zen: Meditations .<br>Blueprint: Greenhead Chimes introduces our core Atmosphere layer mixer in Blueprint . This mixer, included in many of our libraries, contains three differently processed signals created from original samples. This expands the sonic capabilities of the instrument and makes it instantly inspiring to play.<br>The library is part of a framework created by the developers of Fracture Sounds , which served as the basis for creating pitched percussion in Zen: Meditations .</p>
<p>Interface :<br>• Increase to achieve greater stereo range, decrease to reduce spread in the dry audio signal<br>• Soften the initial transition of the dry signal – great for creating pads<br>• Increase damping to reduce sampling<br>• Control the overall level of the built-in reverb with advanced settings by clicking per gear<br>• Manage 4 different layers. The raw layer is the raw original samples, while the other 3 layers are the processed sounds<br>• Control the dynamics of the Atmosphere layers only (Modulation Wheel&#x2F;CC1)<br>• Increase the sample start time to reduce latency. Reduce sample start time for more realism. The delay above is the right number to use a negative delay (pre-delay) in your DAW’s MIDI settings<br>• Increase the attack response to emphasize the volume difference between a soft and hard attack. Lower the slider to increase the soft dynamics volume</p>
<p>Features :<br>• Recorded in an outdoor children’s play area<br>• Up to 6 looping algorithms<br>• 3 custom Atmosphere layered mixer pads that can be used individually<br>• Sound shaping controls<br>• Simple and user-friendly interface<br>• Full NKS support: works with Komplete Kontrol</p>

<p>Description : Explore an endless combination of real acoustic and analog electronic materials</p>
<p>The concept behind The Creator is to combine different sounds and types of sounds to create something new and inspiring. With three sound sources and over 200 synths, live instruments and textures to choose from for each, the number of different combinations is seemingly endless.</p>
<p>Each of the three voices coming from The Creator has its own dedicated mix channel with gain, pan, tuning, filter, ADSR and modulation. This allows for detailed customization and experimental sound design to be carried out simultaneously.</p>
<p>The multi-console gives you quick access to a variety of effects, including reverb with 10 modes, using the impulse responses of hardware reverb blocks, as well as delay, drive, phaser, chorus and gain to quickly create an effect without having to download any additional plug-ins.</p>

<p>Description : “Glacial” is the latest premium library from Origin Sound – a carefully selected collection of samples containing an entire sound universe populated by cascading melodies, sublime atmospheres, rich basslines, elegant chord progressions, effects and much more.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of this comprehensive library begins with professionally arranged drum loops. While these loops are carefully mixed and perfect for the mix, each drum loop comes as stems with percussion and treble drum sounds, as well as separate kick drum and snare grooves, giving you freedom when it comes to creating your rhythm. A variety of additional percussion loops are also included that can easily be combined with the rest of the stems. Drum loops provide great insight into how the arrangement of the 76 single drum samples included in the library was created.<br>In addition, “Glacial” provides a wide range of musical loops and single samples, covering all elements such as ethereal synths, unique melody lines, emotional chord progressions and signature basslines. Expect to hear instruments such as vintage synths, fluttering strings, gentle rhodos, moving guitars, cosmic vocals, ambient plucks and more. Each chord progression, bassline and melody also comes with a MIDI file, giving you the freedom to create your own sounds. 23 additional musical single samples are included for use in any samplers to effectively create your own instruments, or even for use as tonal effects throughout your mixes.</p>
<p>The effects presented in this library contain a range of characteristics: from organic build-ups, shimmering build-ups, to humming tones. These textures can be used in your arrangements to easily create transitions, smooth or even abrupt, or serve as an additional layer to your loops. Not to mention a large selection of bonus ambiences, which are especially useful when placed subtly in a mix as a supporting element for your crisp drum lines and warm bass lines.</p>
<p>“Glacial” is one of our largest libraries available with the highest audio quality. Ideal for those who want to create the illusion of a vast soundscape in their mixes.</p>
<p>Content :<br>•76 Warm drum hits<br>•10 Fluent drum loops (Full bounces and stem bounces)<br>•10 Extra perc loops<br>•20 Bonus lush atmospheres<br>•14 Thick bass Loops (including Midi files)<br>•17 Beautiful chord Loops (including Midi files)<br>•25 Atmospheric melody Loops (including Midi files)<br>•20 Foley infused SFX<br>•23 Musical one shots<br>•Tempos – 115PM</p>

<p>Description :<br>bx_XL V3 allows mastering engineers to create loud mixes without compromising sound clarity.<br>Using mid&#x2F;side technology from the innovative Brainworx bx_digital equalizer, you can split the mid channel into two bands (low and high frequencies).<br>This allows control of three separate channels – mid-low, mid-high and side, resulting in increased volume and significantly improved audio clarity<br>with less artifacts and greater audio clarity.  </p>
<p>Additional information:</p>
<p>The Crossover Frequency slider allows you to determine where the mid-low frequency band ends and the mid-high frequency band begins. This allows you to separate out the kick drum and apply different limits to the rest of your mid-range signal—an important technique for mixes that need a strong bottom end, such as dance, rap, techno, and rock. Once the three channels of the bx_XL V3 are combined back into a stereo signal, the mix is ​​put through a true peak limiter. This means four stages of limiting, resulting in loud and crystal clear stereo mixes.<br>XL controls add warmth to your mixes by adding third and fifth order harmonics. A special filtering process prevents aliasing, ensuring your mixes are free of artifacts. This additional harmonic content increases perceived loudness without significantly increasing the output level of your music.<br>Building on the legacy of the bx_XL V2 – the first mastering limiter for mid and side frequencies, allowing individual listening of mid and side signals with phase correction using Phase-X crossover filters – the V3 includes a three-band “psychoacoustic” loudness maximizer and a host of detailed mastering meters that makes it a first-class dynamics and volume control system.  </p>
